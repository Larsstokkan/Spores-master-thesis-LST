Master thesis LST

This github contains code used in my master thesis: Innovative biotechnological applications of B. subtilis spore surface display (BSSD) for AlgE-type mannuronan C-5 epimerases: An NMR-based study

Included is code used for making growth curves for B. subtilis, as well as code for visualising NMR data, and TEV protease data visualization.
